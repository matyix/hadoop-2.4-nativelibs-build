Hadoop build - native libs of 2.4.0
==============

Often when we use Apache Hadoop and would like to change versions you'll have to rebuild the whole Hadoop, native libs, etc ... which takes 30+ minutes, and carries lots of dependencies (libraries, protobuf, etc - at a given version).

This Docker image contains a Hadoop 2.4 nativelibs build.

## Build the image 
docker build -t sequenceiq/hadoop-nativelibs .

## Run the container
docker run -it sequenceiq/hadoop-nativelibs /bin/bash

## Copy files from the container
docker cp ID_OF_THE_CONTAINER:/tmp/hadoop-2.4.0-src/hadoop-dist/target/hadoop-2.4.0/lib/nâ”‚
ative/ DESTINATION
